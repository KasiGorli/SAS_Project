##  Project Overview
This project analyzes patient wait times and satisfaction survey data using SAS to uncover performance trends across departments and evaluate the relationship between delays and satisfaction outcomes. It includes data cleaning, transformation, statistical analysis, and the creation of a Power BI-ready summary.

##  Objectives
- Clean and process raw appointment and satisfaction data.
- Calculate patient wait times and identify delays.
- Analyze the relationship between delays and satisfaction.
- Generate department-level insights for reporting in Power BI.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `appointments_data.csv` â€“ Raw appointment scheduling data.
- `satisfaction_data.csv` â€“ Patient satisfaction survey data.
